                    <p class="center-text">The Xbox brand launched in November 2001 with the original Xbox, the first major U.S.-made console since the Atari Jaguar. It sold over 24 million units and was followed by the Xbox 360 (2005), Xbox One (2013), and Xbox Series X|S (2020). From 2012 to 2015, Xbox also served as Microsoft’s digital media brand. In 2022, Xbox became part of the Microsoft Gaming division, which includes major publishers like Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda (ZeniMax), and Activision Blizzard. Phil Spencer has led the Xbox division since 2014.</p>
                    <p class="center-text">Popular Xbox games and franchises include Halo, Gears of War, Forza, Fable, The Elder Scrolls, Minecraft, and Call of Duty. These titles have been central to Xbox's success and continue to shape its identity across console generations.</p>

                    <p class="center-text">The Xbox 360 launched in 2005 and played a key role in expanding Xbox Live, offering online multiplayer, digital downloads, and streaming media services. It evolved into a multimedia hub with features like Xbox Music, Xbox Video, and PC media streaming. Despite early hardware issues, including the infamous “Red Ring of Death,” redesigned models (Xbox 360 S and E) improved reliability. The console became the best-selling American-made console, with strong influence on digital distribution and online gaming. Microsoft ended hardware production in 2016, and the digital store shut down for new purchases in 2024.</p>
                    <p class="center-text">Popular Xbox 360 games include Halo 3, Gears of War, Mass Effect, Forza Motorsport 3, Fable II, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and Red Dead Redemption. These titles defined the generation and helped establish Xbox Live as the premier online console gaming service.</p>

                    <p class="center-text">The Xbox One, launched in 2013, returned to x86 architecture with a custom AMD APU and introduced cloud computing, advanced social features, and a redesigned controller. It supported Blu-ray playback, game streaming to Windows 10 devices, and optional Kinect 2.0 integration. Later models included the Xbox One S (2016), with HDR and 4K video support, and the Xbox One X (2017), offering true 4K gaming. Though praised for its media capabilities and quieter design, it faced early criticism for its UI. Production ended in 2020 with the launch of the Xbox Series X/S.</p>
                    <p class="center-text">Popular Xbox One games include Halo 5: Guardians, Forza Horizon 4, Gears 5, Sunset Overdrive, Ori and the Blind Forest, and Sea of Thieves. These titles showcased the console’s power and Xbox Game Studios’ expanding lineup.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p class="center-text">Released in 2020, the Xbox Series X and Series S feature custom AMD x86-64 CPUs, solid-state drives, ray tracing, spatial audio, and support for 4K resolution and HDR. The Series X targets native 4K at 60 FPS, while the smaller, digital-only Series S aims for 1440p with 4K upscaling. Both support nearly all Xbox One, Xbox 360, and original Xbox backward-compatible titles, with improved performance. Microsoft promoted a smooth generational transition through features like Smart Delivery. As of June 2024, Xbox Series consoles have sold over 28 million units worldwide.</p>
                    <p class="center-text">Popular games for Xbox Series X/S include Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, Starfield, Flight Simulator, Hi-Fi Rush, and Hellblade II. These titles highlight the consoles’ graphical power and Microsoft's focus on Game Pass and first-party exclusives.</p>
