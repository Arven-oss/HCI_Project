                    <p class="center-text">The PlayStation gained popularity for its extensive game library, iconic franchises, low price, and aggressive youth marketing. Released in 1994, it quickly became a major success, selling over 4,000 games and 962 million units. It was the first console to ship over 100 million units, cementing its place as a gaming icon. The PlayStation's use of compact discs instead of cartridges revolutionized the industry, offering better storage and enabling more expansive games. This innovation laid the foundation for future consoles, including the PlayStation 2 and the more affordable PS one in 2000.</p>

                    <p class="center-text">Announced at E3 2003 and released in 2004, the PlayStation Portable (PSP) was the most powerful handheld console of its time and Sony’s first major challenge to Nintendo’s handheld dominance. It featured advanced graphics, multimedia capabilities, and connectivity with PS2, PS3, and PCs. The PSP used Universal Media Discs (UMDs) for games and movies, setting it apart as both a gaming device and portable media player. Selling over 80 million units across a decade, it saw several hardware revisions before being succeeded by the PlayStation Vita. PSP production ended in 2014, and UMD production ceased in 2016.</p>
                    <p class="center-text">Popular games on the PSP included God of War: Chains of Olympus, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Daxter, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, Patapon, and Lumines.

                    <p class="center-text">The PlayStation Vita, launched with a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, dual analog sticks, and optional 3G support, aimed to deliver console-quality gaming on the go. A slimmer 2000 model followed in 2013–2014 with better battery life and an LCD screen. Despite strong hardware and early interest, sales declined due to smartphone competition and limited AAA support. Sony shifted focus to indie developers and Japanese studios, building a niche fanbase for JRPGs and visual novels. Selling an estimated 15–16 million units, the Vita was discontinued in 2019. A related device, the PlayStation Portal, launched in 2023.</p>
                    <p class="center-text">Popular games on the PlayStation Vita included Persona 4 Golden, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Killzone: Mercenary, Gravity Rush, Tearaway, Freedom Wars, and Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. These titles showcased the system's capabilities and unique features, helping it stand out despite commercial challenges. The Vita also became a haven for indie games and Japanese imports, securing a dedicated fanbase, especially among fans of RPGs and narrative-driven experiences.</p>
